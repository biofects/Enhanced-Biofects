## Notes
My Home Assistant runs in Docker on a server. I don't use the supervised version, nor do I send any data to Home Assistant servers. This is my personal choice, despite it requiring more manual management.
  
  <strong style="color:red;">I don’t know how it works with HAOS.</strong>

- I prioritize securing my network by blocking **phone home** calls from IoT devices, ensuring data privacy.
- My Home Assistant setup includes an array of devices, with plans to expand further. Here’s a snapshot of what I manage:

    - 💡 Hue
    - 🏠 Tuya
    - 📊 Grafana for monitoring
    - 🎞 Emby for media
    - 🚪 Door locks
    - 🔒 Cameras
    - 💻 Local AI (on server)
    - 🚦 Pi Hole for ad-blocking
    - 🖥 Full network & server monitoring, including GPU & storage
    - 🌀 Fans
    - And much more to come!

## 🔧 Plugins I Use to Achieve My Layout
These are the essential plugins that helped me craft my use of the Enhanced Biofects Theme experience:
- [ha-biofects-fullmenu](https://github.com/biofects/ha-biofects-fullmenu) - My Home page is a dynamic full page animated enu.
- [simple_sticky_note](https://github.com/biofects/simple_sticky_note) - A simple card to leave real time messages in the card, without leaving the page or popups.
- [Sidebar Card](https://github.com/DBuit/sidebar-card) – For an easy-to-navigate sidebar.
- [Wall Panel](https://github.com/j-a-n/lovelace-wallpanel) – A powerful screen saver.
- [Kiosk Mode](https://github.com/maykar/kiosk-mode) – Hides UI elements for a streamlined experience.
- [Card Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) – Add custom styling to cards.
- [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins) - For my custom layouts

### Card Mod setup for Settings backgrounds

The background image on Settings, Developer Tools, and other non-dashboard
pages requires Card Mod to load as a frontend module. A Lovelace resource alone
only loads Card Mod on dashboards.

1. In Home Assistant, open **Settings > Dashboards**, select the three-dot menu,
   and open **Resources**.
2. Find the Card Mod resource and note its exact URL, including any query string
   such as a `hacstag` value when present.
3. Add that same URL under `frontend.extra_module_url` in
   `configuration.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   frontend:
     extra_module_url:
       - /local/community/lovelace-card-mod/card-mod.js
   ```

4. Restart Home Assistant, then clear the frontend cache or perform a hard
   refresh.

Keep the HACS-managed dashboard resource in place. When Card Mod updates, update
the `extra_module_url` to match the new resource URL.

## 🔧 Optional plugins I validated that work
- [Restriction Card](https://github.com/iantrich/restriction-card) – Lock access to things like thermostats. 🔒
- [Unifi Gateway](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.unifigateway)
- [Unifi Counter Sensors](https://github.com/clyra/unifics)
- [Clock Weather Card](https://github.com/pkissling/clock-weather-card)
- [Kiosk Mode](https://github.com/maykar/kiosk-mode) – Hides UI elements for a streamlined experience.

## 🛠 How I Created My Layouts

To get the layout I wanted with the Enhanced Biofects Theme, I combined various plugins and customization:

1. Updated each dashboard to support **Wall Panel**, **Sidebar Card** and **Kiosk Mode**.
2. YAML for content and views should be placed above the dashboard views.
3. Example using UI and Sections:  
   [ui.yaml](./examples/ui.yaml)
4. Example With a custom header and Greeting Sensor:  
   [lovelace-dashboard.yaml](./examples/lovelace-dashboard.yaml)
- Please note for the Custom Header with greeting and Quote you will need some additional templates and sensors in your configuration yaml files.
    [otherconfigs.yaml](./examples/otherconfigs.yaml)
